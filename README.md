# CloudBooth : The Skyâ€™s Facial Recognition ðŸŽ¯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Error 404


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Francisa Thankachan- Model Engineering College
- Member 2: Jacob Saji - Model Engineering College


### Project Description
CloudBooth is a real-time AI-powered web app that detects, tracks, and analyzes clouds in the sky. Built with Streamlit, OpenCV, and custom vision logic, it classifies clouds based on unique traits like aspect ratio, solidity, and area. Users can upload an image to let CloudBooth generate fun labels and a live leaderboard of the most iconic clouds.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Despite centuries of staring at the sky, humanity has yet to formally judge clouds. We donâ€™t know which one is the longest, the puffiest, or the most dramatic. There's no leaderboard. No cloud clout. It's 2025, and clouds are still just... floating aimlessly.
-#That ends now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using AI-powered cloud detection and real-time video processing, it tracks every passing puff and ranks them like sky celebrities. With live stats, labels, and a cloud leaderboard, itâ€™s finally possible to judge clouds... because why not?
